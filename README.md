# Page Rank Algorithm Simulation (Parallel Processing Final Project)

### Motivation

Given a "web" of pages (links from one page to another), determine the page rank using parallel processing techniques. The goal is to minimize communication between processes, thus creating a faster algorithm. In order to complete the project in a limited time span, remove the need for any load balancing. The given web of pages will always follow the same pattern: page 1 links to page 2 and to page n; page 2 links to page 1 and to page 3; page 3 links to page 2 and to page 4;...;page n - 1 links to page n - 2 and to page n.
